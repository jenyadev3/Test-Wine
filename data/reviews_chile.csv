"119715";"Chile";"The 2012 vintage was so hot in Chile that harvests came very early. Thus finding mature, complex SBs in this year won't be easy. This perennially excellent wine is as good as you'll find in 2012. Scallion, lime and other green aromas precede a zesty, hard-driving palate.

"332";"Chile";"Frosted aromas of orange creamsicle, lychee and melon give this an elevated, unique sort of bouquet. Among Chilean Gewürztraminers, this is one of the more expressive ones you'll find. Pineapple, mango and other tropical flavors are pleasant, while the feel is forward and fun. Drink this summer with fish and salads.";"Visión";"86";"15";"Casablanca Valley";NA;"Michael Schachner";"Cono Sur 2008 Visión Gewürztraminer (Casablanca Valley)";"Gewürztraminer";"Cono Sur"
"328";"Chile";"Opening aromas of vanilla cookie show a resemblance to Animal Crackers, while the palate is more vivacious and tangy, with flavors of orange, tangerine and apple. We wouldn't call this an elegant or refined wine, but we like its no-issues attitude and citrusy content. Probably good with salads and seafood.";"Legado Reserva";"86";"18";"Limarí Valley";NA;"Michaеl Schachnеr";"De Martino 2007 Legado Reserva Chardonnay (Limarí Valley)";"Chardonnay";"De Martino"

"324";"Chile";"Mildly minty and woody on the nose, with grass, wintergreen and cheese aromas as well as red fruit. The palate is tight and grabby, with a blast of citric acid that gives the plum and raspberry flavors a tart, decidedly “red” personality. Snappy and crisp on the finish, making it a fresh, lean style of Cabernet.";"Gran Araucano";"86";"35";"Colchagua Valley";NA;"Michaеl Schachnеr";"J. & F.

"319";"Chile";"Fiery and wild at first, with aromas of cinnamon, pepper and Juicy Fruit gum. Strange as that may sound, the wine finds a more familiar place on the palate, where plum, cherry and cassis flavors are flashy and the feel is a bit clangy. Rounds out with air and settles down fairly nicely.";"Reserva";"86";"18";"Curicó Valley";NA;"Michаеl Schаchnеr";"Aresti 2007 Reserva Merlot (Curicó Valley)";"Merlot";"Aresti"

The palate is full and tannic, while flavors run sweet, creamy and slightly syrupy, with chocolate and spiced fig notes.

"190";"Chile";"Clean and honest up front, with moderate richness and modest telltale Casablanca pineapple aromas. The plate is creamier than many wines in this price range, with flavors of apple cider, citrus and some pith.

"189";"Chile";"Bisquertt usually does well with its value-priced Merlots, and seeing that 2007 was an excellent vintage in Chile, this wine excels in the value price range. The nose is dark and saturated, but pure and inviting. And the palate is ripe and smooth, with spice, plum, blackberry and herb notes, particularly anise. Finishes clean, smooth and peppery.

"186";"Chile";"Composed and structured, with its fair share of richness manifested as raisin and molasses. Interestingly, the palate rings with acidity, resulting in a feel that's borderline sharp. But there's enough fruit and heft to balance things out, and the flavors of cherry, blackberry and cola are nice.

This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine.

"166";"Chile";"Dry, briary aromas of field brush, black olive, herbs, berry fruits and saucy tomato are textbook Maipo. This is fresh, a touch choppy, and not overly heavy.

"165";"Chile";"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits. All together, this is a classic Chilean red blend, with fine tannins and patented lightly herbal, balsamic flavors.

"104";"Chile";"A bright nose with green apple and citric aromas comes with mild oak. This is acidic and racy in composition, with roundness along the edges of the palate.
